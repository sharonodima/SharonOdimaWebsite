    <h2 class="border-top">About Sharon</h2>
    <p>I was born and raised in Kenya, Africa and I have been in the states for the past 11 years. During this time, I have been a jack of all trades, as you can see on my <a href="/SharonOdimaResume.pdf" download>resume</a>, dabbling in the travel industry as a flight attendant, in customer service and in home health care both as a certified nurse and a home aide.</p>

    <p>I attended Durham Technical Community College here in Durham, NC where I earned my associates degeee in science. My favorite classes were anything to do with math or statistics.</p>

    <p>I am very excited to be embarking on this rigorous journey to become a fully certified software engineer and I cannot wait to get into the job industry and actually put my skills to work.</p>
    <p>Some of the programming languages I am familiar with include but are not limited to the following: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>JavaScript.</li>
      <li>HTML.</li>
      <li>CSS.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I work well both as an individual as well as in group settings and I am more than willing to collaborate with other software engineers on any future projects.</p>
